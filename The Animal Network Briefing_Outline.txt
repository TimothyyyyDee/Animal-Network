The goal of the Animal Network, which from now on be referred to as the AN, is to eliminate enemies of the network. These individuals are usually corrupt human beings who deserve to be cleansed. First, our investigators send the info to our court department. Then, our court investigates them, and after settling any objections in our appeals court, our operations departments craft and execute plans. The animal network is to be based in London, Ontario.
2.0
The AN is to be divided into multiple departments. The head of the AN is the Command Council(CC) which is the highest decision-making committee that can veto almost everything. The Administrative department does office work such as looking over applications, record-keeping, and other such tasks. The planning department plans all our operations, and the operations command department directs the execution of them. The Operation departments are Special, Mass, Cyber, Aggression, Mass, and Deterrent. Our Internal Affairs department handles internal problems and training, and our Investigation department handles investigations of adversaries.
